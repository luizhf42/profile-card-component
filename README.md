## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had the opportunity to use some CSS properties that I hadn't used until this project (like background-image) and practice Flexbox.

### Continued development

I want to continue aprimoring my CSS knowledge to make better (and responsive) designs and practice semantic HTML markup.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Background Tutorial (W3schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp) - This tutorial helped me to set the background images in the website (even I haven't made it very well, at least it works).
